# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) – Beginner Lab (Enterprise-Oriented)

## Overview

This repository contains a **concept-first, enterprise-aligned lab** that demonstrates how **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** systems are designed and implemented on **enterprise data platforms**.

Rather than focusing on prompt tricks or API usage, this lab explains:
- how documents become **searchable semantic memory**
- how retrieval and generation are **separated by design**
- how AI answers can be **grounded, explainable, and auditable**

The architecture and patterns used here mirror how RAG is implemented in **real enterprise AI platforms**, especially in regulated or data-sensitive environments.

## Who This Is For

- Beginners learning what RAG *actually is*
- Data engineers / data architects moving into **AI platform design**
- Solution architects exploring **enterprise GenAI adoption**
- Trainers and educators teaching **conceptual AI system design**

No prior knowledge of RAG or AI systems is assumed.

## What Problem This Lab Addresses

Large Language Models (LLMs):
- do not know your internal documents
- cannot safely reason over proprietary data
- may hallucinate without clear evidence

This lab demonstrates how RAG solves those problems by:
- retrieving information from **your data**
- constraining the model to retrieved context
- enabling **traceability and citations**
